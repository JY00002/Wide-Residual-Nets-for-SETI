# Effsubsee _ml4seti_ Code Challenge

This is the repository of ___Effsubsee___, the winner of the ___ml4seti___ __Code Challenge__, organized by the [___Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute___](www.seti.org).

The objective of the _ml4seti_ was to train a classifier to differentiate between the following signal types:
* brightpixel
* narrowband
* narrowbanddrd
* noise
* squarepulsednarrowband
* squiggle
* squigglesquarepulsednarrowband

Check out the [_ml4seti_ Github](https://github.com/setiQuest/ML4SETI) for more details.

The criterion to select the winning entry was the (multinomial) _LogLoss_ of the model. 

Here are the final LogLoss measures of the competing teams on the Preview and Final test datasets:
